## Automated WhatsApp message event
Once triggered using a hidden feature like a game, this event will trigger an automated message to be sent via WhatsApp to the users set emergency contacts

Emergency contacts will be set via the users account , using postgresql and django all auth

Messaging will be sent using MessageBird API

Message will be sent via WhatsApp and be very generic as it's for testing purposes - WhatsApp require official business proof for specific message types which we won't have at the time of creation
