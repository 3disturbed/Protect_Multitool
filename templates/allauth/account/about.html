    <h2>Proactive Safety Measures: The Key to Staying Safe</h2>
    <p>Staying safe isn’t just about reacting to danger—it’s about being prepared and taking steps to prevent harm. Here's how you can proactively protect yourself:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Always Share Your Plans</strong>
            <p>Let someone know your whereabouts: Share your destination, who you’re meeting, and when you’ll return.</p>
            <p>Example: “I’m heading to Green Café to meet Sarah at 4 PM. I’ll text you when I get home by 6 PM.”</p>
            <p>Tools like Multitool Protector make this process seamless by allowing you to log plans and automatically notify a trusted contact.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Trust Your Instincts</strong>
            <p>If something feels off, trust your gut. Don’t hesitate to say no or leave a situation that feels unsafe.</p>
            <p>Remember, you don’t owe anyone an explanation for setting boundaries or prioritizing your safety.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Recognize Red Flags</strong>
            <p>Be mindful of manipulative behaviors, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excessive flattery or attention.</li>
                <li>Requests for secrecy about your plans or relationship.</li>
                <li>Attempts to isolate you from friends or family.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Plan Ahead</strong>
            <p>Always know how to get home, even if your plans change unexpectedly.</p>
            <p>Set checkpoints for long journeys, updating your trusted contacts at regular intervals.</p>
        </li>
